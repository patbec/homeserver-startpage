<sup>(1)</sup>
High contrast view is for people with low vision. Activate the `forced-colors` scheme under `More Tools -> Rendering` in Chrome Dev Tools to get a preview.<br>
The colors used are determined by the browser, see at W3C CSS Color Module Level 4 - [6.2. System Colors](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#css-system-colors).

<br>

<sup>(2)</sup>
Some application icons are not available as vector graphics, they have been redrawn and may differ slightly from the manufacturer's icon. See [icon-node-red.svg](/images/icon-node-red.svg) as an example, I also upload customized files to [this](https://worldvectorlogo.com/logo/node-red-2) page.
